# nixdoc

## Context

Popular programming languages tend to have documentation generators.
A documentation generator is a tool that typically reads source code and generates documentation in HTML or some other form.

The presence of a documentation generator for a programming language typically results in widespread use of it for the generation of documentation of libraries.

## Goals
Develop a documentation generator for the nix ecosystem.
